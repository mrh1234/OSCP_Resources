You can find here a SQLi wordlist that helps identifying SQLi vulnerabilities. This wordlist helped me to identify every SQLi vulnerabiliy in every OffSec lab I did. There is a version without encoding and a version with URL encoding. The payloads focus on time-based exploitation. So, when you use e.g. Burp Intruder, then you have to watch for delays in the server response. If you found a significant delay, chances are high that you found a SQLi vulnerability and that you use the payload for further exploitation of the SQLi vulnerability.
