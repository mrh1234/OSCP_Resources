Located here are two Windows shell creator scripts that encode (1) a reverse shell and (2) a Powercat loader command, so that you can run _powershell -e base64Payload_ to get a proper reverse shell. For example, you can use this to upgrade a web shell.

Furthermore, you can find here the source code for a Windows executable and shared library, which you can use when exploiting a privilege escalation vulnerability. The code adds a new Administrator user _hacker_ to the Windows system, and it enables remote desktop and management access for that user.
